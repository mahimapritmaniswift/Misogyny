                    Hello! We are the founders of 'Aasha', meaning 'Hope' in Hindi! We created this NGO together to
                    fight
                    against all issues regarding the infringement of the most fundamental rights of women and girls.
                    Our
                    way
                    of fighting against these issues is by raising awareness of all the different factors that
                    accumulate in
                    doing so. We express our opinions, experiences, and thoughts on all topics being discussed, but
                    most
                    importantly, we make sure that data and news provided that doesn't belong to us, come from
                    reliable
                    sources and with full consent from private individuals.

                    That being said, let us introduce you to ourselves - all members of Aasha.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <i> <b>Mahima Pritmani:</i> </b> Mahima was the first to begin this organization. She was born on
                    the 10th of June,
                    2008.
                    She began this organization as an homage to the generations of women who have fought tirelessly and
                    vociferously for their rights, for our rights - those we have today. She began it as an homage to
                    those girls and women who still continue to be deprived of their fundamental rights. Facing forms of
                    misogyny herself, she realized that millions of other women and girls are victims of more henous
                    violences. Mahima advocates for human rights through her writing in Integrated Humanities, Language
                    and Literature, and even French. She activlely participates in class discussions when a topic sparks
                    her itnerest and even participates in MUN.
                    She then came together with her other friends who share the same passion, compassion
                    and urgency to fight against misogyny, discrimination and other violences.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <i> <b>Huda Karroum:</i> </b> Huda was born on the 31st of October, 2008 and she's Lebanese. Huda's
                    birthday is on
                    halloween, which is qite interesting, if we must say. Huda has always cared deeply for the rights of
                    women and girls and always putting her thoughts in her school work and advocating through social
                    media to reach her relatively large audience. Huda is humerous and incredibly funny, making her an
                    individual who easily grabs the attention of others so she can spread her messages and throughts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <i> <b>Bhavyaa Thakur:</i> </b> Bhavyaa Thakur was born on the 6th of October, 2008. She, like all
                    other members,
                    has a deep passion towards fighting for the rights of women and girls all over the world to bring
                    peace and equity. Through forms like debate, MUN and writing, she gets her message out with
                    incredible
                    ease.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <i> <b>Vyoma Patel:</i> </b> Vyoma was born on the 18th of January, 2008, being the eldest of the
                    other 3 members of
                    Aasha. Vyoma is very passionate about various discrimination against women and fighting against them
                    to give all women and girls the life they deserve, the life that must never be deprived of the most
                    basic, fundamental human rights.
