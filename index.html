	<h2 class='topictwo'> Male Gaze vs. Female Gaze: </h2>
	<h3 style="text-align:justify;font-size:medium" class=First> To put it simply,'The Female Gaze' is essentially the
		way in which
		women are
		protrayed through the eyes of a
		woman, while 'The Male Gaze' refers to the manner in which men portray women in a way such that men get
		empowered after diminishing a woman's role as a subject and turning her into an object for the sake of male
		pleasure. </h3>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h4 class='topictwo'> Social Media:</h4>
	<h5 style="text-align:justify;font-size:medium" class=First> Social media has been a fuel for various kinds
		of misogyny
		resorting from
		different male figures expressing their blatantly dehumanizing views of women that may come in the form
		of being sexual, verbal, or anything along the lines of that. These messages are then passed on to young
		viewers, both male and female - but largely male - or even older users, who then collectively come
		together to beat up female users for their presence of that social media platform, expressing their
		hypocrisy and only liking a certain trait on one woman while hating it on the rest. For instance, the
		age long idea of sexualizing clothes has been deemed as attractive for many men, but in the same manner,
		when a woman who is not of interest to that particular man, the said clothes would - instead of being
		attractive - be deemed "provocative", "attention-seeking", and "disgraceful". This, as a result, creates
		endless insecurities in female users, but especially younger, more vulnerable ones.

	<h6 class='topictwo'>Family:</h6>
	<h6 class="first"> <b>We mirror what we see; this begins with our families. Our families are our biggest
			influencers,
			always
			forming a base of what to believe, whether you want to believe in the same things or not. In our
			families, we experience several traditional beliefs such as expecting women to be the cooks and the
			men
			to be the money makers, hence creatign a path for men to be deemed as having the more "important"
			role
			in society. Our families, for instance, also give us an idea of how to treat women. Many fathers
			might
			make jokes out of the mother's insecurities, they might undermine their work, dismiss their feelings
			and
			emotions, and then all of these are mirrored as a result, creating a never-ending cycle of
			misogyny.</b>
